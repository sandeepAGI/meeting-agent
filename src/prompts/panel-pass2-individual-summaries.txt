TRANSCRIPT (with mapped speaker names):
{{transcript}}

INSTRUCTIONS:
Your task is to create brief, focused summaries of what each panelist contributed to the discussion.

For each panelist (excluding brief moderator interventions):
1. **Main Focus**: What was the primary topic or angle they presented?
2. **Implementation Details**: How did they describe using AI/automation in their company?
3. **Key Points**: 3-5 specific insights, examples, or lessons they shared
4. **Challenges Mentioned**: Any obstacles, concerns, or limitations they discussed
5. **Notable Quotes**: 1-2 direct quotes that capture their perspective (if particularly insightful)

GUIDELINES:
- Focus on WHAT they said, not just that they spoke
- Capture concrete examples and specific implementations
- Note any unique perspectives or contrarian views
- Keep each summary concise (150-300 words)
- For the moderator, briefly note their role in facilitating discussion

OUTPUT FORMAT (JSON only, no additional text):

      "speaker_name": "Derek Moeller",
      "role": "Moderator, CognitionWorks",
      "summary_type": "moderator",
      "contribution": "Facilitated discussion, provided AI overview. Highlighted the distinction between AI, machine learning, and automation. Asked probing questions about implementation challenges and ROI."
    },

      "role": "PTA Plastics",
      "summary_type": "panelist",
      "main_focus": "AI for quality control and defect detection",
      "implementation_details": "Implemented vision systems for automated inspection on production lines. Reduced manual QC time by 40%.",
      "key_points": [
        "Vision systems now detect defects humans miss",
        "Initial setup required 6 months of training data",
        "ROI achieved within 18 months"
      ],
      "challenges_mentioned": [
        "Resistance from QC team initially",
        "Required significant upfront investment in cameras and compute"
      ],
      "notable_quotes": [
        "The AI doesn't get tired at the end of a shift - that's where we saw the biggest quality improvement"
      ]
    }
  ]
}

IMPORTANT:
- Be specific and concrete - avoid vague statements
- Capture the unique value each speaker brought to the discussion
- If a speaker said very little, note that briefly rather than padding the summary

CRITICAL: Your response must be ONLY the JSON object shown above. Do not include any explanatory text before or after the JSON. Do not wrap the JSON in markdown code fences. Start your response with { and end with }.
