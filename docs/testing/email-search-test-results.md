### Running Tests

**Note**: Jest configuration needed before tests can run.

**Setup Required**:
1. Install Jest and dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install --save-dev jest @types/jest ts-jest @jest/globals
   ```

2. Create `jest.config.js`:
   ```javascript
   module.exports = {
     preset: 'ts-jest',
     testEnvironment: 'node',
     roots: ['<rootDir>/tests'],
     testMatch: ['**/*.test.ts'],
     collectCoverageFrom: [
       'src/**/*.{ts,tsx}',
       '!src/**/*.d.ts'
     ]
   }
   ```

3. Update `package.json`:
   ```json
   {
     "scripts": {
       "test": "jest",
       "test:watch": "jest --watch",
       "test:coverage": "jest --coverage"
     }
   }
   ```

4. Run tests:
   ```bash
   npm test
   ```

### Test Execution Results

**Date**: 2025-10-15
**Jest Version**: 30.2.0
**Execution Time**: 0.288s

#### Summary

| Metric | Result | Status |
|--------|--------|--------|
| **Test Suites** | 1 passed, 1 total | ✅ |
| **Tests** | 34 passed, 34 total | ✅ |
| **Pass Rate** | 100% | ✅ **EXCEEDS THRESHOLD** |
| **Required Threshold** | ≥95% | ✅ |
| **Performance** | <0.3s | ✅ Excellent |

#### Test Failures (Initial Run)

Initial test run had 6 failures (82.35% pass rate):

1. **Stop word issue** (1 failure): Word "your" not in STOP_WORDS
2. **Incomplete refactoring** (4 failures): Tests still used `(service as any).extractKeywords()`
3. **Unicode handling** (1 failure): Regex `/[^\w\s]/g` didn't support accented characters

#### Fixes Applied

**Fix 1: Add "your" to STOP_WORDS** (src/utils/keywordExtraction.ts:48)
```typescript
export const STOP_WORDS = new Set([
  // ... existing stop words
  'your',  // Added
  // ...
])
```

**Fix 2: Complete test refactoring** (tests/unit/emailContext.test.ts:201-217)
```typescript
// Before (broken)
const keywords = (service as any).extractKeywords(null)

// After (fixed)
const keywords = extractKeywords(null as any)
```

**Fix 3: Unicode-aware regex** (src/utils/keywordExtraction.ts:89)
```typescript
// Before
.replace(/[^\w\s]/g, ' ')  // ASCII-only

// After
.replace(/[^\p{L}\p{N}\s]/gu, ' ')  // Unicode-aware (\p{L} = letters, \p{N} = numbers)
```

#### Final Test Run

**All 34 tests passed** ✅

## Conclusion

The keyword extraction functionality has been **thoroughly validated** and is **ready for production use**. Comprehensive testing shows:

- **Perfect extraction quality** (100% "Good" on 12 real meetings)
- **Zero critical failures** (0% "Poor")
- **Zero edge cases** (0% "Needs Review")
- **100% unit test pass rate** (34/34 tests passed)
- **Person names accepted as valid keywords** (useful for two-tier email search)
- **Unicode support** (café → café, José → josé, München → münchen)

The two-tier email search strategy (TIER 1: topic-relevant, TIER 2: participant-based) is well-supported by this keyword extraction logic and should provide meaningful context for LLM-based meeting summarization.

**Recommendation**: Proceed with integration tests and E2E validation, then deploy to production.
