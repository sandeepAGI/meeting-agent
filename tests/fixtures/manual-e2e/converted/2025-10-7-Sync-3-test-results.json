Sandeep was when Matt, the controller was sort of confronted with this is a series was confronted with, you know, the end of our contract with PWC to implement Oracle and there was a bunch of sort of rules based stuff that hadn't been done.And and basically he was, he was suffering from, I'm working too hard, you know, I don't have any faith in these PWC guys. But basically he got to a point where he was just like, I'm just not going to worry about it. I can fix it in Excel.Give me Hyperion and Excel and I can do what I need to do.

If you take all the laws related to the 1933 Securities Act.And or or if you take all the all the relevant data to our Treasury decision making and then you have a conversation with an agent who is basically your Treasury advisor who has been taught a lot of stuff about your policies and your rules and how to optimize different things. And maybe it's got some examples of models you've built and you know you you feed it a lot of that stuff.And then you say, how can I make this better, right? I'm trying to reduce the number of of days of funding that are stranded in, you know, other than the top three countries or something like that. Like, you know, give it a problem to solve like that and and you know, it might go ahead and build a model to try and do it.But if you go, wow, that's actually a better solution, then you can go, OK, I think I need to build a production system to do what this thing just, you know, wing together.So is there, I guess I'm thinking, is there, is there a model where you sort of build a New York Life Treasury agent who is your partner in crime and much more, much more structured than just, you know, using Claude as a thought partner?"

But but one thing he told me that was funny was he went down a whole path of trying to teach it to write like him, which worked out really well. And then he started asking questions about him and like what insights it had about him from his writing. And it almost guessed his Myers Briggs profile right. It was off by one letter.Which would be interesting because it's hard to guess if someone's an introvert from their writing, I think. But it said he was an introvert when he's really an extrovert, but the rest it got right. It it also guessed that he's Jewish based on the themes in his writing.Which I thought was really interesting. So this stuff is getting this, this stuff is getting pretty, pretty, yeah, pretty.

The but my point I guess was he he gave me some more information about the different systems they use.Issues they've been having with trying to extend their CRM into their e-mail because their e-mail's on Gmail. And if you're if you don't migrate to Exchange, apparently in Outlook, it's a problem. Anyway, so there's a bunch of stuff for them to navigate it. They're not equipped for it at all.And you know, when I talked to him a little bit about like, like James's situation and somebody offering him, you know, a bunch of robots for $500,000, he was like, that's insane. And I was like, yeah, that's what we said, you know, but but the point is, if you do it some other way, then there's what kind of lifestyle are you stepping into? You need help navigating that and preparing for it. I told him, you know, he asked."

Maybe we come up with a product idea together. At least we learned something about the space that'll help us with other clients in the space, he said. That sounds great. So.So you know, maybe sell some more free work that hopefully leads to something more than that. What I was going to say was I thought was interesting was in addition to all the public information they use, this is something James hadn't mentioned. He said they calculate a couple of different Middlemarch is the name of their company, Middlemarch partners.Middlemarch indices they call them which are basically like do we like this company or not and how and do we like and do and then and then what they try to do is use that profiling and scoring technique to what they would love to have AI do is find them more companies like this one.

        "text": ":08Last, I think he's, I think he's, I think he's got two locations now if I'm not mistaken. I think he's got something like 200 employees. They are, you know they they do what I was calling high touch contact center stuff for one of their specialties is.Where there's a smart card for use per payment for transit by transit systems, they they do the kind of first line. I lost my card, the value screwed up, I can't access the website, like all that ****, all the help desk stuff basically for that. They do that for the Dallas transit system for Edmonton.For Phoenix and one or two others. So you know they they've they've really made a a niche there partly through a partnership with a software company that built the systems in all those markets. They've also done a bunch of healthcare related work with the dental plan in like the Blue Cross dental plan in.In Texas and that some of that is contact center stuff and there's a lot of HIPAA compliance there. Some of it is is also like print related stuff like maintaining the directory of doctors and printing that out on demand when people need it and stuff like that. He he, he, I may have told you this before he's often said.That he finds he makes a lot of money and doing things that nobody wants to do. And so print is something he's actually said. It's actually something he kind of wants to double down in lately because when he.I think when he sells a print job, he outsources a lot of the print work and he makes a fixed margin on making it happen, basically on the sort of managing the project and managing the service levels and the client interface and all that. And then I think he's also done, I don't know if he's still doing it, but he's also done a bunch of.Also kind of high touch multi language contact center stuff for cell phone companies also around billing and customer service and stuff like that and all of it's on shore, right. So they're competing with efficiency, with quality people, with sort of value added services.He he is almost, he has almost no data in house on you know the like client data and so forth. That all sits in the customer's CRM and he intentionally to avoid any kind of cybersecurity and liability and all that stuff or HIPAA compliance or whatever. He doesn't bring that data.Into internal systems. So all of what they're doing is working on the client data. But for some of these things, like these HIPAA compliant kinds of things, things you need to do, things you can't do, answers to questions about what's possible and what's not and all that. That's a great knowledge management example that I'm sure and he and I have talked about it and I think he's been experimenting.So I think doing stuff around knowledge management is probably a no brainer. Generally thinking about maybe things that could enable him to offer additional services that would be complimentary, you know, chat bot kinds of things to say, hey, we can do instead of doing the voice response system as the first line of defense for navigating these calls, we can offer it, you know.We can offer a chat bot and I could see them providing services around writing the scripts and things like that. So I think that we'd have to listen to him and kind of he's he's definitely been, you know, reading Ethan Malik, reading lots of blogs about this, thinking about it a lot, playing with it a lot.But he's kind of the, you know, a little bit like a little bit like James. He's the he's the big brain in the in the business. He's got one or two other people like a CFO and an IT guy who are engaged with him, but he's the one who drives all the innovation, so.The question will be, can we help him? You know, is he getting stuck? Can we help him think more broadly? Can we help him maybe turn the crank faster?Basically be his outsource center of excellence, that kind of thing."

He always feels like if he does consulting, he's helping someone else's P&L more than he's helping his own. So he kind of tries to limit it, but he's people contact him as an expert to help.Like fix their technology and help them select packages and stuff like that so that they can work with him more efficiently. You know, when he was establishing the Edmonton system and so on, he was doing a lot of consulting and I think Phoenix as well, doing a lot of consulting with them about this goes here and that goes there and you know, here's how you set up the the trees and all, you know, he just, he knows that stuff cold now.It's actually an American Studies major undergrad. He kind of the last guy you would have thought would be an entrepreneur. He wanted to be an academic. And after he got his master's, you'll relate to that. After he got his master's, he kind of burned out on academia and didn't stay for the PhD. So he moved to Austin to get his master's in American or his PhD in American Studies.Wanted to be a prof like his dad."
