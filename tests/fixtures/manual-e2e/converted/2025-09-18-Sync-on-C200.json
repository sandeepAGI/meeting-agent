We're not creating huge enterprise systems that are all like behemoths that can't connect, et cetera. Like we still have fundament.Mental process tools that we can use, but what we can build around them and on top of them and things like that are is the customization. And So what that gives you is the balance of where the pendulum has been swinging."

So basically very clearly tying out some of the potential of AI and how AI can parlay into success into what your next steps are supposed.Supposed to be right. So this is, you know, gotten a little busy, but I think it's just honestly just saying three things per slide. I mean per per per swimly, right? What do you do today? Well, how do you build on that and what's your, you know, long term competitor boat?So the idea is these are our suggestions ABC. The risk is risk of non action right? And end with the big one.
