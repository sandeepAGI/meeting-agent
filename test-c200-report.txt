üìÑ EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:
  Sandeep Mangaraj and Clare Gorman held a final preparation meeting for their upcoming C200 (Committee of 200) presentation on AI implementation for business leaders. They refined presentation slides for better clarity, established alternating speaker roles with soft handoffs, and coordinated a live demo featuring Melissa from Charles Schwab presenting a real cybersecurity challenge. The interactive session expects 6-20 senior business leaders and aims to secure follow-up opportunities and potential invitation to the prestigious Nashville Summit. Key messaging focuses on AI enabling efficient customization after years of SaaS standardization, with emphasis that moving slowly on AI adoption is the highest risk strategy.

4. AUDIENCE ENGAGEMENT STRATEGY FOR SENIOR BUSINESS LEADERS

   Key Points:
   ‚Ä¢ Expected 6-20 attendees from C200 membership, small group enabling intimate discussion
   ‚Ä¢ Emily unable to change timing due to existing acceptances but will provide attendee profile information
   ‚Ä¢ Lisa (event sponsor) confirmed as backup questioner if audience participation is slow
   ‚Ä¢ Previous C200 experience showed 'opinionated bunch' going off-script with barely covering one slide
   ‚Ä¢ Strategy to prime audience with positive/negative AI experience sharing rather than round-robin format

   Decisions:
   ‚úì Make presentation highly interactive with questions encouraged throughout
   ‚úì Focus on volunteer sharing rather than forcing participation from all attendees
   ‚úì Prepare for extended discussion on early slides if engagement is high
   ‚úì Target business leaders rather than technical staff based on promotion messaging

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

5. STRATEGIC AI ADOPTION MESSAGING AND FRAMEWORK

   Key Points:
   ‚Ä¢ Core message that 'moving slow is the high risk strategy' for AI adoption
   ‚Ä¢ Positioned AI as enabling return to efficient customization after reaching limits of SaaS standardization
   ‚Ä¢ Framework emphasizes progression from experimentation to data integration to proprietary solutions
   ‚Ä¢ Clare's pendulum analogy: SaaS drove standardization optimization, AI enables efficient customization without creating technical debt
   ‚Ä¢ Prototype validation distinguished from production deployment and governance requirements
