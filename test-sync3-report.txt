üìÑ EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:
  This was the final preparation meeting for Sync #3 with New York Life's Treasury team scheduled for October 8th. The team finalized their presentation deck on Gen AI adoption in financial services, with key findings that financial services and Treasury functions are lagging behind other industries in AI adoption. Speaking roles were assigned: Sandeep handling introductions and context, Gil presenting industry findings and framework, and Ojas providing Treasury expertise. Materials were sent to Tom's team before the meeting. The team also discussed broader business development opportunities in private credit firms and workforce analytics, while continuing to develop proprietary AI tools.

üí≠ NOTABLE QUOTES:
  1. Gil Brodnitz: "It's amazing to me how powerful it was to have this visualization of the meeting. You know, because it put me, it put me in the meeting, right? And it was good. And it's a really good thing to be there."
  2. Sandeep Mangaraj: "The real value is in growth, not just efficiency. I would not say that and I know Gil, you would not say it, but I just wanted to highlight that because the value is not just in growth, I think the value is in both."
  3. Gil Brodnitz: "More than other parts of finance and operations and so on, it doesn't have to feel like this is about efficiency, you know, taking people's jobs. This is about getting all the undone work done in the Treasury organization that could add value to the bottom line."
  4. Ojas Patel: "By design, you cannot protect yourself. So because you cannot have any any, you can't protect yourself from running the bank, right? It's a judgment call."
  5. Gil Brodnitz: "A world of disposable software is pretty interesting."
  6. Sandeep Mangaraj: "Anything that takes agency away from humans. I just don't want to be a part of it. And if anything, right, you know, we need to be basically in a place in which we empower people to be able to do a lot more using these tools."

  1. Will Tom's team provide feedback on the presentation materials before the meeting?
